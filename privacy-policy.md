# Privacy Policy (PDFDone)

Last updated: 2026-02-08

PDFDone (“the App”) helps you scan, merge, and edit PDFs on your device. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how it is used.

## 1) Data We Collect
PDFDone is designed to work primarily on-device.

**Documents & Files**
- PDFs, photos, scans, signatures, and annotations you create or import are processed on your device.
- We do not upload your documents to our servers.

**Purchases**
- If you purchase a subscription, Apple processes the payment.
- We may receive non-personal purchase status information from Apple (e.g., active subscription / entitlement) to unlock Pro features.

**Analytics / Crash Data (if enabled)**
- We may collect limited, non-identifying usage and crash diagnostics to improve stability and performance.
- This data does not include the contents of your PDFs, photos, or scans.

## 2) How We Use Information
- Provide core app functionality (scan/edit/export PDFs).
- Enable Pro features and restore purchases.
- Improve performance and fix bugs (analytics/crash diagnostics if enabled).

## 3) Data Sharing
- We do not sell your data.
- We do not share document contents with third parties.
- Apple and app platform services may process purchase-related data as required for subscriptions.

## 4) Data Storage & Retention
- Your documents remain on-device unless you choose to share/export them.
- Temporary files created during export may be stored briefly on-device and can be removed automatically by the app or iOS.

## 5) Permissions
The App may request:
- Camera access (to scan documents).
- Photo library access (to import photos).
These permissions are used only for the requested feature.

## 6) Your Choices
- You can choose not to grant camera/photo permissions (some features won’t work).
- You can manage subscriptions in your Apple ID settings.
- If analytics/crash reporting is available, you can disable it in system/app settings where supported.

## 7) Children’s Privacy
PDFDone is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
